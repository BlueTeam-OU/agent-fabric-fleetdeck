## What a herdr server stop/restart keeps for moveto agent tabs, measured; consequences for fabric-deck and piece 2

Measured on 2026-10-07 with an isolated `herdr server` built from fork master 4cdc2765. Two tabs were made as
herd.py makes them, each running a long-lived stand-in for a moveto session. No sudo was
available, so it was not a real `sudo -u`.

**Detach or closing the terminal:** nothing is lost.

**`herdr server stop`, then start:**
- Every pane process dies.
- Workspace, tab labels and cwd come back as fresh operator shells, with no moveto and no agent.
- With `[experimental] pane_history = true` the old screen is replayed as text only. It is off by default
  because it stores secrets.
- Native agent-session resume needs the agent's herdr hook to have reported a session reference
  over the API socket. A moveto'd agent cannot: the socket is 0600 and owned by the operator, and
  `socket_access = outside_panes` would refuse it anyway. So moveto agents never resume through herdr.
- Agent status for these tabs is `unknown` even while they run.

**Consequences:**
- herd.py skips tabs whose label exists, so after a restart it leaves bare shells.
- fabric-deck (piece 3) must detect an account tab that is only an operator shell and re-run
  `moveto <account>` in it, without creating a duplicate tab.
- Piece 2's measurement should include this restart case.
