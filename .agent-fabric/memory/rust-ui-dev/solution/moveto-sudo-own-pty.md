## why herdr process-info on a moveto pane never shows claude — sudo use_pty puts the account on its own pty

moveto ends with `exec sudo -n -u <acct> -H /usr/local/share/moveto/enter <dir> <title>`. sudo 1.9.17p2 on develop-qzapp runs it under use_pty (the default since 1.9.14): the pane's tty foreground group is the outer root-owned sudo alone, and the account's bash, launch.py and claude sit on a new pty in a new session. herdr's `pane process-info` reads the pane tty's foreground group (tcgetpgrp, src/platform/linux.rs:663), so it shows only that sudo argv — moveto's mode (last argument) is readable there, the harness never is.

To tell whether the harness runs in a pane, walk /proc/<pid>/stat ppid links down from the foreground sudo (/proc has no hidepid here, so the operator's login can read them). Measured live with `ps --forest` on 2026-10-08; raised to fabric-coordinator as OBSERVATION 01a11ab5 against agent-fabric#115's tab-states.md.
