"""The states of an agent's harness pane, and what the deck does in each.

The contract is agent-fabric's docs/fleet-deck/tab-states.md (#115,

its foreground, and whether a harness runs under that moveto. The account's
stream record tells a pane with no harness whether its session runs
somewhere else, and a pane entered over ssh whether its harness runs
(fabric_deck.ssh_harness). Everything here is pure: the run loop observes, calls
`step`, and carries out the one re-arm it may return.
